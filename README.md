# Employee Recording Program

The Employee Recording Program allows someone in an administrative position to easily log new employees, view existing employees, and update them as well.

# Getting Started

When you run the program, in the command line interface you have 10 options to modify the SQL table: Add, View, and Delete for tables the tables named role, department, and employees; also, there is an option to update rolls.

When Add is selected the user will be asked what role, department, or name they would like to add. If the user chose View for whichever table, the console will bring back an organized listing of the table. If Delete is selected the user will be prompted enter the name of the employee to be deleted.

When update role is selected the user will be asked for the role to modified. Rerunning SELECT * FROM (table) will display the modified table depending on which option was previously selected.
